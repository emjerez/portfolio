## My Portfolio Site
This site was created for my basic information to be up and accessible to the public. This is a basic portfolio site created by using React.js. 

## Getting Started:
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Built With:
React.js
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
